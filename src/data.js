    about: {
        story: "From a top-ranking student in India to a strategic thinker at Northeastern, my journey has been fueled by curiosity, kindness, and a dreamer's mindset. Whether ensuring product quality at Deloitte or mentoring future leaders in Organizational Psychology, I've always believed in the power of collaboration and learning. Known for my friendly and approachable nature, I love connecting with people and helping them grow. Outside of work, you'll find me dancing to my favorite tunes, singing, or getting lost in a good movie—because life's too short not to enjoy the little things while chasing big dreams.",
